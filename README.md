# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## Overview

A Web Based Project where there is authentication using **FIREBASE** and after login in with socials we have a search filter feature to filter them according to their names.

Data Storage is in the form of JSON.

I have also used **react-router-dom** for routing.

**React Hooks** are used.

## Setting Up Firebase

- Go to this website of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
- On top right there is a button 'Go to Console', click on it.
- Add Project, write project name and click on next making it all default.
- After setting up we got authentication tab under Build category.

## Adding your credentails for authentication using firebase

#### NOTE : Your credentails should be in .env file that will be in the root of the app.

- Credentials will be at the project seeting under your apps category.

### NOTE : For Facebook login you have to go to **facebook for developers** and add your app with APP_ID and APP_SECRET_KEY that will be there at firebase console.

---

### _You can fork this repo and add that .env file to run authentication properly_.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
